# Credit-Default-Risk-Analysis
Predicting credit default risk using machine learning (specifically Random Forest, cost-sensitive evaluation)
# Credit Default Risk Analysis

### 🎯 Goal
Predict which credit card customers are likely to default, using machine learning on 30,000+ clients.  

### 🛠 Tools
- Python (pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn)  
- SQL for exploratory queries  
- Jupyter Notebook  

### 📈 Approach
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
3. Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest models  
4. Cost-sensitive evaluation (false negatives ≈ 5× costlier than false positives)  
5. Stress testing and customer segmentation  

### ✅ Key Results
- Best model: **Random Forest (balanced weights)**  
- **ROC-AUC: 0.76 | PR-AUC: 0.54**  
- At threshold ~0.21: recall ≈65%, precision ≈43%  
- Top-decile captures ~30% of all defaulters  

### 🔍 Highlights
- Applied cost-sensitive risk evaluation  
- Delivered segmentation insights for portfolio triage  
- Professional documentation with clear visuals
